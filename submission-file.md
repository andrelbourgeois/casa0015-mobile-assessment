Flutter Application Name - CroissAcq

## Introduction to Application
The intent of this project was to develop a mobile app using Flutter and Dart that would allow a user to press a button and be routed towards the croissant nearest to their location. The app stores user login information (email and password) within Firebase and uses the Google Maps API along with various packages to enable routing from a current location to a desired location. Therefore, the pieces required to build the croissant-finding button are all here. However, I was unable to figure out how to put these pieces together in such a way within the timeline for this assignment. Thus, the app as it is sbumitted demonstrates my current knowledge of mobile development, and showcases; navigation and screen hierarchy, user information handling with firebase, and mapping and routing functionality using Google Maps API and the various mapping packages referenced below.
